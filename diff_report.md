# Automating Weekly BIOS Updates and Price Tracking

## Introduction  
Keeping track of BIOS/firmware updates and price changes for multiple PC models can be tedious. This guide outlines a **weekly automated job** that checks OEM RSS feeds for new BIOS/driver updates and scrapes major UK retailers for price changes. The automation will compile a Markdown **diff report** each week and push it to a GitHub repository. We prioritize a reliable, low-maintenance solution (ideally under 1 hour of upkeep per month) by using well-known Python libraries and GitHub Actions for scheduling.

## Overview of the Weekly Job  
Each week, the automated job will: 

- **Parse OEM RSS feeds** (Minisforum, Beelink, ASUS, HP, Lenovo, Dell, Razer, ASUS ROG) to find new BIOS or driver update announcements related to the target models.  
- **Scrape current prices** of the specified models from UK retailers (Amazon UK, Scan.co.uk, HP UK Store, Lenovo UK, Dell UK, Currys UK).  
- **Compare this week's prices** to last week's prices stored in a CSV file, identifying any **significant changes (≥ ±5%)**.  
- **Generate a Markdown report** listing new BIOS/firmware updates (with titles, dates, and URLs) and any price changes (old price → new price, percentage change, and date).  
- **Commit the report to a GitHub repository** automatically.  

We will use Python for the scripting (with libraries like *feedparser*, *requests*, *csv*, and *PyGithub* or Git for automation) and set up a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow (or a cron job) to run the script weekly. The script is written in a modular way to allow easy expansion (e.g., adding new models or vendors in the future).

## Parsing OEM RSS Feeds for BIOS/Firmware Updates  
Many OEMs publish product news or support updates via RSS feeds. We will use the **Feedparser** library to retrieve and parse these feeds:

- **Feed URLs:** Determine the RSS feed URLs for each OEM’s support or news site (e.g., a support bulletin feed or forum feed for BIOS updates). For example, some OEMs might have dedicated RSS links for driver releases or a general news RSS that includes BIOS update announcements. These feed URLs can be stored in a list or config file in the script for easy maintenance.  
- **Using Feedparser:** Feedparser greatly simplifies reading RSS/Atom feeds. It has a single primary function `feedparser.parse()` which can fetch and parse a feed from a URL in one call ([FeedParser Guide - Parse RSS, Atom & RDF Feeds With Python | ScrapeOps](https://scrapeops.io/python-web-scraping-playbook/feedparser/#:~:text=The%20first%20method%20is%20to,have%20it%20parse%20the%20response)). For example:  
  ```python
  import feedparser
  feed = feedparser.parse('https://example.com/oem-support-feed.xml')
  ```  
  This returns a feed object with metadata (`feed.feed.title`, etc.) and a list of entries (`feed.entries`). Each entry typically has attributes like `title`, `link`, `published` (date), and `summary`.  
- **Filtering relevant updates:** To focus on the models of interest, the script can filter the feed entries. For example, if we have a list of model names/IDs, we check each feed entry’s title or description for those keywords. Only entries that pertain to our models will be included in the report. This prevents unrelated news from cluttering the output.  
- **Collecting update info:** For each relevant entry, extract the title (which often contains the update name or version), the URL (link to details or download), and the published date. Store these in a list of updates. If the feed provides a timestamp, use it; otherwise use the entry’s published date string.  
- **Example:** If Lenovo’s feed has an entry titled *“BIOS Update 1.23 for ThinkPad X1 Carbon – March 2025”*, and X1 Carbon is one of our models, we would capture that title, the link, and the date.  

Using Feedparser ensures robust parsing of various feed formats (RSS 2.0, Atom, etc.) without dealing with XML manually ([Introduction — feedparser 6.0.11 documentation](https://feedparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#:~:text=Universal%20Feed%20Parser%20is%20easy,feed%20data%20in%20any%20format)). The library is actively maintained and easy to use, which contributes to low maintenance overhead.

## Scraping Current Prices from UK Retailers  
For each target model, the script will fetch the current price from several UK retailers: **Amazon UK**, **Scan.co.uk**, **HP UK Store**, **Lenovo UK**, **Dell UK**, and **Currys**. We use the **Requests** library to download page content and an HTML parser (such as **BeautifulSoup**) to extract prices. Each retailer’s site has a different HTML structure, so we implement separate parsing logic for each:

- **Product URL mapping:** Create a mapping of each model to its product page URL on each retailer’s website. For example, for a model “XYZ Mini PC”, store the Amazon URL (which might be an Amazon product link or search query), the direct page on Scan, etc. Maintaining these URLs in a configuration makes it easy to update if a product’s page changes.  
- **Fetching HTML:** Use `requests.get()` with appropriate headers (like a **User-Agent** string) to mimic a browser and avoid blocks. For example:  
  ```python
  headers = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"}
  resp = requests.get(product_url, headers=headers, timeout=10)
  html = resp.text
  ```  
  This gets the raw HTML of the page. Always set a reasonable timeout so the script doesn’t hang indefinitely if a site is unresponsive.  
- **Parsing for price:** Use **BeautifulSoup** (from `bs4` library) or similar to parse the HTML and locate the price element. Each site requires a specific strategy:  
  - *Amazon UK:* Amazon’s HTML often includes the price in a span with id or class. For example, the price might be in a `<span class="a-price">` with a nested `<span>` for the amount ([How To Scrape Amazon Data using Python](https://www.scrapingdog.com/blog/scrape-amazon/#:~:text=We%20can%20see%20that%20the,how%20you%20can%20do%20it)). We can find that element and extract text. (Be cautious: Amazon might change their DOM or require login for some prices.)  
  - *Scan.co.uk:* Identify a span or div that contains the price (Scan’s site might have the price in an element with a known class like `.price` or an itemprop for price). Using the developer tools on the product page can help find a unique identifier to target. The script can do `soup.find()` or `soup.select_one()` with a CSS selector for that element.  
  - *HP/Lenovo/Dell Stores:* These official stores typically display price prominently, possibly in an element with id like `price` or within a script as JSON. For simplicity, find a currency symbol (£) in the HTML and capture the number around it. For example, if the page shows `£599.99`, searching the HTML for “£” and grabbing the surrounding text could yield the price. A more robust method is to use known classes or tags (e.g., Lenovo’s site might use something like `<div class="pricing">£599.99</div>` which can be parsed).  
  - *Currys:* The Currys product page often has the price in a tag with classes like `.product-price` or an `<span>` with a specific data-price attribute. Use BeautifulSoup to find that element by class or id.  
- **Data normalization:** Extract the numeric price value as a float for comparison. Remove currency symbols and commas. For example, "£1,299.00" becomes 1299.00 (float). Keep the formatted string as well for displaying in the report.  
- **Error handling:** If a price element is not found (e.g., site layout changed or page not available), log a warning or set that price to None. The script should continue even if one site fails, to ensure one broken source doesn’t stop the whole job. Adding some logging for missing data can aid in maintenance.  
- **Rate limiting:** Since this runs weekly and only fetches a handful of pages, load on the sites is minimal. We can still be polite by adding a short delay between requests or using efficient queries. This helps reliability and avoids tripping any anti-scraping measures.  

By using `requests` and HTML parsing, we avoid reliance on manual checks. We choose lightweight parsing (targeting specific tags) to minimize breakage if the site’s HTML changes. For Amazon, if direct scraping proves unstable, consider using the Amazon Product Advertising API for a more stable interface (requires API keys, so it’s an optional enhancement for reliability).

## Comparing Prices to Last Week’s Data  
Once we have the current prices for each model from each retailer, we compare them against last week’s prices stored in a CSV file:

- **Previous prices CSV:** The CSV (e.g., `last_week_prices.csv`) can have columns like `Model, Retailer, Price, Date`. Alternatively, it could be structured with one row per model and separate columns for each retailer’s price. Choose a format that is easy to read and update. For example:  

  ```csv
  Model,Amazon,Scan,HP,Lenovo,Dell,Currys,Date
  MiniPC X, 499.99, 479.00, 500.00, 515.00, 520.00, 489.99, 2025-04-16
  MiniPC Y, 899.99, 869.00, 910.00, 925.00, 930.00, 899.00, 2025-04-16
  ```  

  This row indicates the prices of **MiniPC X** at various stores on 16 April 2025. The script from last week would have saved this.  
- **Loading previous data:** Use Python’s built-in `csv` module or `pandas`. For reliability and simplicity, the `csv` module works well. For example:  
  ```python
  import csv
  prev_prices = {}  # dictionary to hold old prices
  with open('last_week_prices.csv') as f:
      reader = csv.DictReader(f)
      for row in reader:
          model = row['Model']
          # Store prices as floats for comparison
          prev_prices[model] = { 
              'Amazon': float(row['Amazon']), 
              'Scan': float(row['Scan']),
              # ... similarly for other retailers
          }
  ```  
  Now `prev_prices` is a nested dictionary like `prev_prices['MiniPC X']['Amazon'] = 499.99`.  
- **Calculating differences:** After scraping, assume we have a similar dictionary `current_prices` structured the same way (with float values). We iterate through each model and each retailer, compare current vs previous:  
  ```python
  changes = []  # to collect significant changes
  for model, vendors in current_prices.items():
      for vendor, new_price in vendors.items():
          old_price = prev_prices.get(model, {}).get(vendor)
          if old_price is None or new_price is None:
              continue  # skip if data missing (new model or scrape failed)
          if old_price == 0:
              continue  # avoid division by zero if a price was zero
          # Calculate percent change
          pct_change = (new_price - old_price) / old_price * 100
          if abs(pct_change) >= 5:  # flag changes >= ±5%
              changes.append((model, vendor, old_price, new_price, pct_change))
  ```  
  This will gather any price changes that are at least ±5%. For example, if last week Amazon had £500 and now £550, that’s a +10% change and will be flagged. If the price moved only 2%, it’s ignored as insignificant noise.  
- **Formatting percentage:** It’s helpful to round the percentage change to one decimal place for the report (e.g., 10.0% rather than 10.000234%). Also mark the sign or direction (we can add a “+” for increases).  

We make sure to handle cases like a missing previous price (perhaps a newly tracked model) or a missing current price (if scraping failed) by skipping those comparisons. This way the script won’t crash and will only report meaningful differences.

## Generating the Markdown Diff Report  
After obtaining the list of new BIOS updates and the list of significant price changes, the script generates a Markdown-formatted report. The report will have two main sections and use a clear layout for easy reading:

- **File format:** We can create a Markdown file (e.g., `weekly_report.md`) and write the content to it. Each run could overwrite the same file (if we keep history in Git, each commit serves as a record), or use a date in the filename (e.g., `report-2025-04-23.md`). Using a single file name is simpler for automation, but using dated filenames provides an archive of past reports in the repo. For this example, we’ll assume a single rolling file for simplicity.  
- **Header:** Include a title or date at the top of the report. For instance:  
  ```markdown
  # Weekly BIOS Update & Price Change Report (2025-04-23)
  ```  
  This clearly labels the report with the date of generation.  
- **New BIOS/Firmware Updates section:** Under a heading like `## New BIOS/Firmware Updates`, list each new update found in the RSS feeds. Each item can be a bullet point including: 
  - **Model/Update Title:** If the feed entry title includes the model name and version, you might just use the title. Otherwise, include the model name explicitly. 
  - **Brief description (optional):** If the RSS entry has a summary like “Fixed stability issues…” you could include a short snippet. However, to keep it concise, you might skip details or just note it's a BIOS or driver update.
  - **Link:** a hyperlink to the OEM page or forum post for more information (this could be the entry’s link).
  - **Date:** the publication date of the entry (to know when it was released).  
  For example:  
  ```markdown
  **Minisforum EliteMini X500 – BIOS v1.2.0** – Released 2025-04-20. [View update](https://minisforum.com/support/x500-bios-v1.2.0)
  ```  
  Each bullet highlights the model/update and provides a direct link. If no new updates were found for that week, you can simply state “*No new BIOS or firmware updates this week.*” under this section.  
- **Price Changes section:** Under a heading like `## Price Changes (≥ 5%)`, list the models that had notable price shifts. For each change, include: 
  - **Model and retailer:** e.g., *“MiniPC X – Amazon UK:”* 
  - **Old price → New price:** show the old and new price side by side. Using an arrow or arrow-like syntax makes it clear it's a change. For example, *“£500 → £550”*. 
  - **Percentage change:** show the percentage and direction. E.g., “(+10%)” or “(-7.5%)”. You might color-code this with Markdown (red/green text) if desired, but plain text plus/minus is fine.
  - **Date of change:** since the report itself is dated, you could omit an explicit date on each line, or you could state the date checked (which is essentially the report date). If multiple weeks are compared, date helps, but here it's always week-to-week.  
  An example bullet:  
  ```markdown
  **MiniPC X – Amazon UK:** £500.00 → £550.00 (**+10.0%** as of 2025-04-23)  
  ```  
  If multiple retailers changed for the same model, you can list them on separate bullets (or group by model with sub-bullets). Grouping by model might read like:  
  ```markdown
  **MiniPC Y:**  
  - Dell Store: £900 → £840 (**-6.7%**)  
  - Lenovo Store: £920 → £970 (**+5.4%**)  
  ```  
  This groups all changes for MiniPC Y together. Use whichever format is clearer for the reader. The key is that only changes ≥5% are listed, which keeps the report focused.  
- **Formatting considerations:** Keep the Markdown simple (avoid overly long lines). Use bold for model names to make them stand out. Ensure the percentage is clearly marked with a plus or minus. If no prices changed ≥5%, you can write something like “*No significant price changes this week.*”  

The result is a Markdown file that highlights new updates and significant price moves in a human-readable form. This diff report can be reviewed quickly to see which models need BIOS updates applied or which have notable price drops/increases.

## Committing the Report to GitHub  
Once the report (and possibly updated CSV) is generated, the final step is to commit these files to a GitHub repository. This makes the information accessible and version-controlled. We have two main options to automate the commit: using **Git directly** in the workflow or using **PyGithub** (GitHub’s Python API library) within the script. 

**Option 1: Commit via Git (in CI workflow):**  
In the GitHub Actions workflow, after running the Python script, use git commands to push changes. GitHub Actions provides a special `GITHUB_TOKEN` that can commit to the repository. For example, in the workflow steps:  

```yaml
- name: Configure Git
  run: |
    git config --global user.name "GitHub Actions"
    git config --global user.email "actions@github.com"
- name: Commit report
  run: |
    git add weekly_report.md last_week_prices.csv
    git commit -m "Weekly report $(date +%F)" || echo "No changes to commit"
    git push
```  

This configures a commit identity and then stages the modified files (the report and the CSV), commits with a message (using the date), and pushes to the repository. The `|| echo "No changes..."` ensures the step won’t fail if there were no differences (no changes to commit) ([Running a script at a URL in a repo environment? · community · Discussion #69570 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/69570#:~:text=,0%27%20run%3A%20git%20add)). Note that you must ensure the `GITHUB_TOKEN` has permissions to push (in your workflow yaml, set `permissions: contents: write`). This approach is straightforward and keeps the Git logic in the workflow.  

**Option 2: Commit via PyGithub in the script:**  
PyGithub allows making GitHub API calls from Python. You could use it to create a commit, but it’s a bit more involved. For example:  

```python
from github import Github
import os
token = os.environ.get("GITHUB_TOKEN")
g = Github(token)
repo = g.get_repo("username/repo-name")  # target repo
# Prepare commit
with open("weekly_report.md", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()
repo.create_file("/reports/weekly_report.md", "Add weekly report", content, branch="main")
```  

This would create a new file (or raise error if exists). For updating, you’d use `repo.get_contents()` then `repo.update_file()`. While feasible, this method is less direct than using git, and it requires storing the token securely. Since our job is already running in GitHub Actions, the git CLI method is perfectly sufficient and arguably simpler.  

Using Git to commit also means if multiple files change (report and CSV), they can be part of one commit. PyGithub would need multiple API calls. Therefore, we favor the git in workflow approach for reliability.

## Automation with GitHub Actions (Weekly Schedule)  
To run this whole process every week without manual intervention, we use **GitHub Actions** with a scheduled trigger. Below is an example workflow YAML configuration (`.github/workflows/weekly-report.yml`):

```yaml
name: Weekly BIOS & Price Check

on:
  schedule:
    - cron:  '0 6 * * 3'   # Runs every Wednesday at 6:00 UTC (adjust as needed)

jobs:
  update-report:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'  # or whichever version is required

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install feedparser requests beautifulsoup4 PyGithub

      - name: Run update script
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: python update_report.py

      - name: Configure Git
        run: |
          git config --global user.name "GitHub Actions"
          git config --global user.email "actions@github.com"

      - name: Commit and push changes
        run: |
          git add weekly_report.md last_week_prices.csv
          git commit -m "Weekly report - $(date +'%F')" || exit 0
          git push
```

**Explanation:**  
- The `on: schedule:` uses a cron expression to schedule the run. In the example above, `'0 6 * * 3'` means every Wednesday at 6:00 AM UTC (which would be weekly). You can adjust the day/time as needed. The schedule event triggers the workflow automatically ([Events that trigger workflows - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#:~:text=schedule%3A%20,Change%20this%20value)).  
- The job checks out the repo (so the script and CSV are present), sets up Python, installs required libraries (feedparser, requests, etc.).  
- The script `update_report.py` encapsulates all the steps discussed: parsing feeds, scraping prices, generating the report, and writing the CSV. It’s invoked with the GitHub token in the environment (only needed if using PyGithub inside; for pure git usage, the token is used by the checkout and push steps).  
- After the script runs, we configure Git with a bot identity and commit any changes. We use `|| exit 0` or `|| echo ...` to prevent errors if there are no changes (e.g., no price changes and no new updates in a given week means the script might not alter the files).  
- Pushing back to the repository updates the Markdown report file and the CSV for next time. The committed Markdown can be viewed directly on GitHub for a quick read.

This GitHub Actions approach means we don't need to maintain a separate server or cron job. GitHub handles running the workflow on schedule. The only maintenance would be updating the script if a website changes or adding new models/vendors, which can be done by pushing a commit.

*(If one preferred a self-hosted solution, they could set up a cron job on a server or even a serverless function to run weekly. In that case, store credentials to push to GitHub via HTTPS (using a personal access token) or SSH. However, GitHub Actions is low-friction and free for such periodic tasks.)*

## Ensuring Reliability and Low Maintenance  
To keep this system **robust** and with minimal ongoing effort, consider the following practices: 

- **Modular Code Design:** Organize the Python script into functions or classes for each part (e.g., `fetch_feeds()`, `scrape_prices()`, `compare_prices()`, `generate_report()`). This makes it easy to modify one part (like adding a new retailer parser) without affecting the rest. New SKUs or vendors can be added by adjusting configuration lists rather than rewriting logic.  
- **Use of Stable Libraries:** We rely on well-tested libraries: Feedparser for RSS (handles many feed edge cases internally), Requests for HTTP (simple and robust), and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing. These libraries handle a lot of the heavy lifting. For example, Feedparser’s single-call parse from a URL simplifies RSS retrieval and parsing in one step ([FeedParser Guide - Parse RSS, Atom & RDF Feeds With Python | ScrapeOps](https://scrapeops.io/python-web-scraping-playbook/feedparser/#:~:text=The%20first%20method%20is%20to,have%20it%20parse%20the%20response)), reducing potential bugs.  
- **Error Handling & Logging:** Implement try/except around network calls (`requests.get`) and parsing routines. Log any errors (e.g., if a feed URL is down or a price element isn’t found) either by printing to console (viewable in Actions logs) or writing to a log file. This helps identify issues quickly if the report fails or has missing data. Since the job is weekly, a quick check of the Action run or the output file can alert you to any parsing failures that might need fixing.  
- **Timeouts and Retries:** Use request timeouts and possibly retry logic for feed and price fetching. This prevents a hang or transient network issue from failing the entire job. Given the low frequency, a simple approach is fine (e.g., try each fetch twice before giving up).  
- **Data Validation:** After scraping, ensure the price values make sense (e.g., not zero or extremely small/large due to a parsing glitch). If an anomaly is detected, you could skip it or keep last week’s value, and perhaps log a warning. This prevents one-off HTML issues from triggering false alerts.  
- **Maintaining Configuration:** The list of model names, feed URLs, and retailer URLs should be easy to update. Consider storing them in a separate JSON or YAML config file that the script reads. This way, adding a new model or changing a URL doesn’t require touching the code logic. For instance, `models.yaml` could list each model and the URLs for Amazon, Scan, etc., and the script loops through that.  
- **Test Occasionally:** Even though it’s automated, it’s wise to manually run the script (or monitor the GitHub Action runs) especially after any change. A quick local test or test in Actions can ensure all parsing still works if websites had minor changes. This should be well under an hour per month.  
- **Security:** The GitHub token is kept secret by Actions – no special handling needed unless using external credentials. If you use any API keys (for Amazon API, etc.), store them as encrypted secrets in the repository settings and access via environment variables. Avoid printing them in logs.

By following these practices, the workflow should run smoothly each week. **Low maintenance** means you primarily just review the reports, and only intervene if something breaks (like a site redesign causing the scraper to miss a price, which should be infrequent). The modular structure means such fixes or enhancements (e.g., adding a new OEM feed) are straightforward.

## Guide to Reading the Weekly Diff Report  
The generated Markdown report is designed to be human-friendly. Here’s how to interpret it:

- **Report Header:** At the very top, the report includes the date (and possibly a title). This date is when the report was generated (essentially the “as of” date for the data). For example, a header saying **2025-04-23** means all information is up to date as of April 23, 2025.  
- **New BIOS/Firmware Updates:** In this section, each bullet point represents a BIOS/firmware or driver update announcement from an OEM for one of your tracked models. For each update, you typically have:  
  - The **model or product** that the update applies to. If the title doesn’t clearly show the model, our script might prepend it.  
  - The **version or name of the update** (often included in the title, e.g., BIOS version number).  
  - The **release date** of that update post – knowing how recent it is.  
  - A **hyperlink** (usually on the text “View update” or the title itself) which you can click to see details or download the update from the OEM’s site.  
  *Reading tip:* If you see an entry like *“Minisforum EliteMini X500 – BIOS v1.2.0 – Released 2025-04-20”*, that means a new BIOS version 1.2.0 for the Minisforum EliteMini X500 was released on April 20, 2025. You should consider visiting the link if you own that model to get the update details or files. If a week’s report has **“No new BIOS or firmware updates this week.”**, it means none of the OEM feeds had relevant new posts since the last report.  
- **Price Changes (≥5%):** This section lists only the models (and specific retailers) where the price has changed significantly (5% or more up or down) compared to last week’s price. Each line tells you:  
  - **Which model and which retailer** had a price change. For example, “MiniPC X – Amazon UK” indicates the Amazon UK price for MiniPC X changed notably.  
  - **Old Price → New Price:** The arrow separates last week’s price and this week’s price. Both are shown with currency (£ for UK) and typically two decimals.  
  - **Percentage Change:** In parentheses, the percentage change is given. A **+** indicates an increase in price (the item got more expensive), and a **−** indicates a decrease (it got cheaper). For instance, “(+10.0%)” means a 10% price hike, while “(-6.7%)” means a 6.7% price drop. We only list changes ≥5%, so you won’t see tiny 1-2% fluctuations here.  
  - **As of Date:** If included (optional, since the report header has date), it reaffirms the date. E.g., “as of 2025-04-23” means the new price was checked on that date.  
  *Reading tip:* If you see *“MiniPC X – Amazon UK: £500.00 → £550.00 (+10.0%)”*, it means last week MiniPC X cost £500 on Amazon, and now it’s £550 – a significant increase. Conversely, *“MiniPC Y – Dell UK: £900 → £840 (-6.7%)”* means the Dell online store had a price drop from £900 to £840, about a 6.7% decrease, which might indicate a sale or discount. Such changes could inform your buying decisions or trigger further investigation.  
  If no items are listed under this section, it means all price movements were under 5% (or no changes at all), implying relatively stable pricing in the last week for the tracked items.

- **Diff Nature of the Report:** The report is essentially highlighting **what changed** in the last week (new updates, significant price changes). It’s not an exhaustive list of all prices or all updates, only the new or changed information. This makes it easy to scan. Think of it as “what’s new or different since last week.” Past data (like last week’s prices) is only shown in comparison to the new data; the report doesn’t reiterate all older information that hasn’t changed.

By regularly reading this weekly report, one can stay up-to-date on crucial firmware updates (ensuring systems are updated for stability and security) and catch any major price drops (perhaps to snag a deal) or price increases (to reconsider a purchase) for the selected models. The Markdown format means it’s viewable directly on GitHub, and differences from week to week can be tracked in the Git history. Each commit of the report can be diffed to see changes as well (although we already format the changes in the content for convenience).

With this automated setup, you have a hands-off way to monitor both BIOS updates and market prices. The solution is built for **reliability** (leveraging stable libraries and services) and **extensibility** (new models or sources can be added with minimal code changes). After the initial configuration, the weekly GitHub Action will take care of data collection and reporting, leaving you with the simple task of reading the report to stay informed. Enjoy your up-to-date overview with virtually no manual effort!
