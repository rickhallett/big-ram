## Timing Advice
Across these models, Black Friday and Prime Day consistently offer the biggest discounts – plan big purchases around those events for 10–30% (or more) off. If current prices remain prohibitive, look to official refurbish outlets (like Dell Outlet, HP Renew, Lenovo Outlet) or reputable resellers (BackMarket, etc.) for professionally refurbished units at a substantial markdown, without waiting for major sale holidays.
