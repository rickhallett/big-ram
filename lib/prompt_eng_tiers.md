## 1. IQ 135 vs 170

**User**

Compare an IQ of 135 to 170 across multiple domains of mental computation, learning, synthesis, creativity and other valuable metrics

**Assistant**

**Percentile distance & statistical context**  
- **135 IQ (σ = 15)** ≈ 99.0‑99.2 percentile → ≈ 1 in 70‑100 people.  
- **170 IQ** ≈ 99.99985 percentile → ≈ 1 in 650 000 people.  

*(A 170 score is 4.7 SD above the mean; most norming samples are far smaller, so error bars balloon in that band.)*

### Mental computation, learning curves, synthesis, creativity, metacognition, social‑affective traits  
(see original assistant reply for full tables and discussion)

## 2. Bipolar × Autoimmune Link

**User**

Are there any established connections between mild bipolar, autoimmune conditions and "Mental‑health risk: Hyper‑intelligent samples show elevated rates of affective disorders and immune‑dysregulation illnesses …"

**Assistant**

- 2021 meta‑analysis of >34 k autoimmune cases → +54 % bipolar incidence (OR≈2.2)  
- Swedish registry (n = 1 M) shows U‑curve: IQ ≥ 135 → 1.24 × pure‑bipolar risk  
- Mensa survey (n = 3 715) finds 2–4 × anxiety, depression **and** immune dysregulation  
- Shared‑locus GWAS, Hyper‑Brain/Hyper‑Body model, mechanistic table, clinical take‑aways
