# Detailed Roadmap

## Mini-PCs

### Minisforum UM890 Pro ‚Äì *Ryzen 9 8945HS* ‚Äì üü° **Previous Gen**  
- **CPU Generation:** 8-core/16-thread AMD **Zen¬†4** CPU (‚ÄúPhoenix‚Äù refresh, codename *Hawk Point*). This Ryzen 9¬†8945HS refreshes 2023‚Äôs Phoenix silicon without a new microarchitectur ([AMD Unveils Ryzen 8040 Mobile Series APUs: Hawk Point with Zen 4 and Ryzen AI](https://www.anandtech.com/show/21177/amd-unveils-ryzen-8040-mobile-series-apus-hawk-point-with-zen-4-and-ryzen-ai#:~:text=AMD%27s%20drive%20looks%20to%20push,cores%2C%20and%20the%20Ryzen%205))„Äë. It runs up to ~5.2‚ÄØGHz boost and carries 16‚ÄØMB L3 cache, similar to the 7940H ([AMD Unveils Ryzen 8040 Mobile Series APUs: Hawk Point with Zen 4 and Ryzen AI](https://www.anandtech.com/show/21177/amd-unveils-ryzen-8040-mobile-series-apus-hawk-point-with-zen-4-and-ryzen-ai#:~:text=Ryzen%209%208945HS%208%2F16%204000,54%20W))„Äë.  
- **iGPU:** Integrated **Radeon 780M** graphics (RDNA¬†3, 12 CUs @ 2.8‚ÄØGHz ([AMD Unveils Ryzen 8040 Mobile Series APUs: Hawk Point with Zen 4 and Ryzen AI](https://www.anandtech.com/show/21177/amd-unveils-ryzen-8040-mobile-series-apus-hawk-point-with-zen-4-and-ryzen-ai#:~:text=Ryzen%209%208945HS%208%2F16%204000,54%20W))„Äë ‚Äì a capable iGPU from the RX 7000 series architecture. No discrete GPU in the small UM890 Pro means this RDNA3 iGPU handles all display output and light 3D tasks.  
- **Platform & Features:** Monolithic 4‚ÄØnm SoC with **PCIe 4.0**, dual-channel **DDR5/LPDDR5X** memory support, and **USB4** (40¬†Gbps) integrated for high-speed I/ ([AMD Announces Ryzen 7040 "Phoenix Point" Mobile Processor: 4nm, Zen 4, RDNA3, XDNA | TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/303022/amd-announces-ryzen-7040-phoenix-point-mobile-processor-4nm-zen-4-rdna3-xdna#:~:text=The%20iGPU%20is%20based%20on,acceleration%20and%20display%20engines))„Äë. Includes AMD‚Äôs first-gen **XDNA AI Engine** (Ryzen AI NPU) for on-chip AI acceleration (~**39¬†TOPS** peak„Äë. Lacks newer Zen5 architectural advances ‚Äì Zen4 is one generation behind AMD‚Äôs latest mobile CPUs (Zen5 launched late 2024).  
- **Roadmap Position:** **Zen¬†4** (Phoenix) was AMD‚Äôs flagship in 2023; by 2025 it is *-1 gen* (one generation old) as **Zen¬†5** APUs roll out. It‚Äôs considered **previous-gen** ‚Äì current enough for today, but will fall further behind **Zen¬†6** (~2026) in IPC and efficiency. The 8945HS is essentially a model-year refresh of Phoenix, so it‚Äôs not **next-gen ready** in terms of core architectur ([AMD Unveils Ryzen 8040 Mobile Series APUs: Hawk Point with Zen 4 and Ryzen AI](https://www.anandtech.com/show/21177/amd-unveils-ryzen-8040-mobile-series-apus-hawk-point-with-zen-4-and-ryzen-ai#:~:text=AMD%27s%20drive%20looks%20to%20push,cores%2C%20and%20the%20Ryzen%205))„Äë.  
- **Future-Standards Readiness:** **USB4 v2** (80¬†Gbps) and **Thunderbolt¬†5** are *not* supported ‚Äì I/O tops out at USB4 (compatible with TB4/DisplayPort 1.4 alt-mode). **DDR6** is a future memory tech (likely ~2026+) and not on this DDR5 platform. Networking is typically **Wi-Fi¬†6E**; Wi-Fi¬†7 can be added via a newer M.2 module, but the platform doesn‚Äôt natively require it. Overall, the UM890‚Äôs I/O is modern for 2024 but **not forward-looking** to upcoming 2025‚Äì2026 standards.  
- **BIOS/Firmware Support:** Minisforum (a smaller OEM) provides firmware updates, but long-term BIOS support can be limited. Major OEMs tend to offer updates for security/compatibility for years, whereas Minisforum relies on community feedback and often sticks to essential fixes. Don‚Äôt expect the depth of validation or timely BIOS updates that a Tier-1 vendor would provide ‚Äì future CPU upgrade compatibility is moot (soldered CPU), and firmware is tuned only for the shipped generation.

### Beelink GTR7 Pro ‚Äì *Ryzen 9 7940HS* ‚Äì üî¥ **-2 Gen**  
- **CPU Generation:** 8-core/16-thread AMD **Zen¬†4** CPU (‚ÄúPhoenix‚Äù family) launched in early 2023. The Ryzen 9¬†7940HS was the original high-end Phoenix S ([AMD Unveils Ryzen 8040 Mobile Series APUs: Hawk Point with Zen 4 and Ryzen AI](https://www.anandtech.com/show/21177/amd-unveils-ryzen-8040-mobile-series-apus-hawk-point-with-zen-4-and-ryzen-ai#:~:text=Ryzen%209%208945HS%208%2F16%204000,54%20W))4„Äë, with up to 5.2‚ÄØGHz boost and 16¬†MB L3. It‚Äôs two generations behind what AMD plans by 2025 (Zen5 is out, Zen6 on roadmap) ‚Äì effectively making it *-2 gen* as we approach 2027.  
- **iGPU:** **Radeon 780M** (RDNA¬†3, 12 CUs) integrated graphi ([AMD Unveils Ryzen 8040 Mobile Series APUs: Hawk Point with Zen 4 and Ryzen AI](https://www.anandtech.com/show/21177/amd-unveils-ryzen-8040-mobile-series-apus-hawk-point-with-zen-4-and-ryzen-ai#:~:text=Ryzen%209%208945HS%208%2F16%204000,54%20W))4„Äë. This GPU supports modern codecs and can drive multiple 4K displays, and even casual gaming. However, it‚Äôs still an RDNA3-class iGPU from 2023 ‚Äì upcoming APUs will move to RDNA¬†3.5/4.0 architectures for higher performance and efficiency.  
- **Platform & Features:** As a Phoenix APU, it shares the same 4‚ÄØnm **monolithic** design with **PCIe 4.0**, **DDR5/LPDDR5** memory, and built-in **USB4 (40¬†Gbps)** for eGPU or dock suppo ([AMD Announces Ryzen 7040 "Phoenix Point" Mobile Processor: 4nm, Zen 4, RDNA3, XDNA | TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/303022/amd-announces-ryzen-7040-phoenix-point-mobile-processor-4nm-zen-4-rdna3-xdna#:~:text=The%20iGPU%20is%20based%20on,acceleration%20and%20display%20engines))9„Äë. Notably, Phoenix was the **first AMD chip with an NPU**, the XDNA-based AI engi0„Äë. In the 7940HS, this **Ryzen AI** engine provides AI acceleration (e.g. for video effects) with roughly **20¬†TOPS** inferencing ‚Äì useful, but far behind newer 50¬†TOPS-class solutions.  
- **Roadmap Position:** **Zen¬†4** mobile is now a *previous-generation* platform. AMD‚Äôs current-gen (2024‚Äì25) is Zen¬†5 based **Strix Point**, which brings IPC gains and more AI performance. By 2027, Zen4 systems like the GTR7 Pro will be decidedly **outdated** in CPU and AI features. It‚Äôs categorized as **-2 gen** in lifespan ‚Äì fine for today‚Äôs workloads, but it will show age as Zen5 and Zen6 become mainstream.  
- **Future-Standards Readiness:** The GTR7 Pro‚Äôs I/O is limited to the standards of its time. **Thunderbolt¬†5/USB4 v2** are not supported (USB4 40¬†Gbps is the max). It uses **DDR5** (up to 5600 MT/s) ‚Äì next-gen DDR6 isn‚Äôt expected until ~2026‚Äì27 and will require a new platform. **Wi-Fi¬†7** (802.11be) is not native; the mini-PC likely includes Wi-Fi¬†6/6E, though one could upgrade the wireless module. In short, it‚Äôs *not ‚Äúnext-gen ready‚Äù* ‚Äì it covers all *current* standards (USB4, PCIe4, Wi-Fi¬†6E) but will need replacement to enjoy upcoming I/O advances.  
- **BIOS/Firmware Support:** Beelink, similar to Minisforum, is an enthusiast mini PC maker with moderate BIOS support. They release BIOS updates to fix issues, but the firmware tends to remain basic (fewer tuning options than big-brand systems). Enterprise-grade longevity (e.g. BIOS support 5¬†years out) isn‚Äôt guaranteed. Users often depend on Beelink‚Äôs forums or community modders for troubleshooting once the product is a couple of generations old.

### ASUS NUC 14 Pro Kit ‚Äì *Core Ultra 7¬†165H* ‚Äì üü¢ **Current Gen**  
- **CPU Generation:** **Intel Core Ultra 7¬†165H**, a high-end **Meteor Lake** mobile CPU (Intel 14th Gen Core, launched late 2023). It uses Intel‚Äôs new hybrid 3-tile design. This chip features **16 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores + 2 LP E-cores)** ‚Äì the 6 performance ‚ÄúRedwood Cove‚Äù cores support hyper-threading (12 threads) and 10 efficient ‚ÄúCrestmont‚Äù cores handle background tasks (22 threads tot ([Intel Core Ultra "Meteor Lake" Processor Lineup Overview | TechPowerUp Forums](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/intel-core-ultra-meteor-lake-processor-lineup-overview.316756/#:~:text=At%20launch%2C%20the%20Core%20Ultra,boost%2C%20and%20a%20maximum%20turbo)) ([Intel Core Ultra "Meteor Lake" Processor Lineup Overview | TechPowerUp Forums](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/intel-core-ultra-meteor-lake-processor-lineup-overview.316756/#:~:text=P,capable%20power%20design))04„Äë. With boost up to ~5.0‚ÄØGHz on P-cores, the 165H matches Intel‚Äôs latest architecture and sits at the top of the Meteor Lake lin ([Intel Core Ultra "Meteor Lake" Processor Lineup Overview | TechPowerUp Forums](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/intel-core-ultra-meteor-lake-processor-lineup-overview.316756/#:~:text=At%20launch%2C%20the%20Core%20Ultra,boost%2C%20and%20a%20maximum%20turbo))00„Äë.  
- **iGPU:** Integrated **Intel Arc Graphics (Xe-LPG)** with all 8 Xe cores enabled (128 EUs). Essentially, it‚Äôs a built-in **Arc GPU** on the CPU package, supporting DirectX¬†12 Ultimate and modern media engines. In the Core¬†7¬†165H, the iGPU clocks up to ~2.30‚ÄØ ([Intel Core Ultra "Meteor Lake" Processor Lineup Overview | TechPowerUp Forums](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/intel-core-ultra-meteor-lake-processor-lineup-overview.316756/#:~:text=At%20launch%2C%20the%20Core%20Ultra,10%20GHz%20maximum))99„Äë and delivers roughly 2√ó the gaming performance of prior-gen integrated graph30„Äë. It fully supports AV1 encode/decode and offers an entry-level discrete GPU experience within the 30„Äë.  
- **Platform & Features:** Meteor Lake is Intel‚Äôs first disaggregated client CPU, using **Foveros 3D stacking** to combine a CPU tile, GPU tile, SoC tile, and I/O tile. It introduces a built-in **NPU (Neural Processing Unit)** for AI ‚Äì Intel‚Äôs **Gen3 NPU with 2 neural compute engines**, offering up to **34¬†TOPS** AI throughput on the top mod ([Intel Core Ultra "Meteor Lake" Processor Lineup Overview | TechPowerUp Forums](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/intel-core-ultra-meteor-lake-processor-lineup-overview.316756/#:~:text=23%20On%20all%20processor%20models%2C,for%20the%20top%20processor%20model))30„Äë. The platform supports next-gen connectivity: **PCIe¬†5.0** for SSDs (e.g. NVMe drive at ~15¬†GB/s) and integrated **Thunderbolt¬†4/USB4** controll ([Intel Core Ultra "Meteor Lake" Processor Lineup Overview | TechPowerUp Forums](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/intel-core-ultra-meteor-lake-processor-lineup-overview.316756/#:~:text=23%20On%20all%20processor%20models%2C,for%20the%20top%20processor%20model))30„Äë. Memory is typically LPDDR5X on laptops, but the ASUS NUC 14 Pro (being a mini-PC) can use **DDR5 SO-DIMMs**. It‚Äôs also ready for **Wi-Fi¬†7** ‚Äì the SoC tile‚Äôs CNVi interface can pair with Intel‚Äôs Wi-Fi¬†7 modu69„Äë. Overall, this kit is built on a **current-gen Intel platform** with a strong feature set for 2024.  
- **Roadmap Position:** As a **14th Gen Core Ultra (2024)**, the 165H is **current-gen** for Intel mobile. It represents the shift to AI-enhanced, power-efficient architectures. Through 2027, it should age reasonably: Intel‚Äôs next-gen (15th/16th Gen *Arrow Lake* and *Lunar Lake*) will bring incremental IPC and GPU improvements, but Meteor‚Äôs feature foundation (AI engine, PCIe5, etc.) keeps it relevant. It‚Äôs not next-gen beyond what‚Äôs mainstream today, but it‚Äôs at the forefront of today‚Äôs tech (especially compared to any 13th Gen or earlier mini PCs).  
- **Future-Standards Readiness:** **Thunderbolt¬†5** (80¬†Gbps) is expected in late 2024/2025, likely with Intel‚Äôs next architectures ‚Äì the NUC¬†14‚Äôs Meteor Lake **does not have TB5**, only TB4 (40¬†Gbps). It does support **PCIe¬†5.0** (already a next-gen feature for storage) and can use **Wi-Fi¬†7** cards, which positions it well for new peripher69„Äë. Memory-wise, DDR5/LPDDR5X is the end-state for this generation; **DDR6** will be introduced by Intel only around 2026+ (likely with Panther Lake or later). So while the NUC¬†14 Pro isn‚Äôt *fully ‚Äúnext-gen‚Äù* (no TB5 yet), it‚Äôs **ready for upcoming standards** in networking and storage ‚Äì more so than any prior-gen mini PC.  
- **BIOS/OEM Support:** ASUS now produces the ‚ÄúNUC Pro‚Äù line (after Intel wound down its NUC business), and ASUS has a decent track record with firmware. Being a Pro kit, BIOS support should be solid: expect BIOS updates enabling new features (e.g. improved memory compatibility) and security patches for a few years. ASUS will likely support vPro features if applicable and maintain driver support via their corporate support channels. In short, this mini-PC should enjoy **better-than-average** firmware support among small PCs ‚Äì closer to a large OEM desktop than to boutique brands.

### HP Elite Mini 800 G9/G10 ‚Äì *Core i7-14700* ‚Äì üü¢ **Current Gen (Desktop)**  
- **CPU Generation:** **Intel Core i7-14700** (14th Gen *Raptor Lake-Refresh* desktop CPU, launched late 2023). This is a 65¬†W-class processor with **20 cores (8 P-cores + 12 E-cores)** and 28 thr ([Intel Core i7-14700 Desktop Processor 20 cores (8 P-cores + 12 E ...](https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-14700-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/dp/B0CQ1QJZM2#:~:text=Intel%20Core%20i7,architecture%20integrates%20two%20core))-L8„Äë, essentially a refresh of 13th-gen Raptor Lake with +4 efficient cores. Architecture-wise it‚Äôs **Raptor Cove** (P-cores) and **Gracemont** (E-cores) on Intel 7 process ‚Äì an evolution of the 12th/13th-gen design, not the new Meteor Lake tech. In the Elite Mini 800 G10, the i7-14700 (or its 35¬†W variant i7-14700T) provides top-end vPro Enterprise performance for a mini desktop.  
- **iGPU:** **Intel UHD 770** integrated grap ([Intel Core i7-14700 Desktop Processor 20 cores (8 P-cores + 12 E ...](https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-14700-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/dp/B0CQ1QJZM2#:~:text=Intel%20Core%20i7,architecture%20integrates%20two%20core))-L8„Äë ‚Äì the same Gen12 Xe-LP graphics from Alder/Raptor Lake desktops. It has 32 EUs and modest clocks, enough for office work and multiple displays but far behind modern Iris Xe or Arc GPUs. (This business mini can be configured with discrete GPUs in some cases, but most units rely on the UHD 770 for graphics output.) The iGPU supports up to 4x 4K displays and Quick Sync video, but it **predates Arc** and offers no AI or ray-tracing features.  
- **Platform & Features:** Being a desktop-based mini, it uses an **Intel Q-series chipset** (e.g. Q670 or Q770) on the motherboard. This provides **PCIe¬†5.0 x16** support (generally unused in the compact chassis) and plenty of **PCIe¬†4.0 lanes** for NVMe SSDs and I/O. **DDR5-5600** memory is supported (the G9/G10 Minis use SO-DIMMs, typically up to 64¬†GB). Unlike Meteor Lake, the 14700 has *no integrated NPU* ‚Äì AI acceleration is limited to software on CPU/GPU and the modest Intel GNA 3.0 for noise cancellation. **Thunderbolt¬†4** can be supported via an add-in module or USB-C port on some configurations, but it‚Äôs not built into the CPU/chipset (HP offers optional TB4 on Elite desktops). Notably, as a vPro-enabled platform, it supports Intel **AMT** for remote management. Overall, the Elite Mini 800 G9/G10 platform is a **current-gen business desktop** design, emphasizing stability and legacy support over bleeding-edge features.  
- **Roadmap Position:** Raptor Lake-Refresh in 2024 is Intel‚Äôs *current desktop generation* (14th Gen) but uses last-gen architecture. It coexists with Meteor Lake (mobile) but for desktops Intel hasn‚Äôt moved to the new core designs yet. Thus the Elite Mini G10 is **current-gen** in the sense of Intel‚Äôs business desktop lineup. Over the next few years, however, Intel will transition desktops to hybrid core designs (Arrow Lake in 2024‚Äì25, then Panther Lake). By 2027, the 14700‚Äôs architecture will be two cycles old (succeeded by Arrow and Panther cores). Still, in enterprise roadmaps this mini will be serviceable for 4‚Äì5 years. HP typically guarantees platform stability, meaning this model will remain **relevant through ~2026** but won‚Äôt get the next-gen perks until a redesign.  
- **Future-Standards Readiness:** As a desktop-oriented platform, it lags in some new standards. **USB4/Thunderbolt¬†5:** The 14700 platform doesn‚Äôt natively support USB4; Thunderbolt¬†4 is optional via add-on. Future TB5 (80¬†Gbps) is not available. **DDR6:** Not supported ‚Äì it‚Äôs locked to DDR5. **Wi-Fi¬†7:** The Elite Mini G10 can be configured with Wi-Fi¬†6E; Wi-Fi¬†7 modules may be offered in later revisions, but the platform is not inherently built for Wi-Fi¬†7 (just an add-in card swap). On the plus side, PCIe¬†5.0 is available (ensuring support for next-gen SSDs and add-ons). Essentially, the G9/G10 is *conservative* on I/O ‚Äì it covers current needs (Gen5 SSD, USB 3.2, TB4 optional) but is **not ‚Äúnext-gen ready‚Äù** for upcoming breakthroughs like TB5 or AI offload. Organizations choosing it value maturity and support over bleeding-edge tech.  
- **BIOS/Firmware Support:** **HP‚Äôs Elite line** has excellent firmware support. Expect regular BIOS updates for security (e.g. TPM, Patch guard) and stability, possibly even CPU microcode updates enabling 14th-gen Refresh support on G9 boards (indeed G9 models were advertised to support 13th and 14th-gen CPUs with BIOS upd ([HP Elite Mini 800 G9 PC - Customizable](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-elite-800-g9-mini-pc-customizable-550b5av-mb#:~:text=HP%20Elite%20Mini%20800%20G9,7E7Z9AV%20HP)) ([[PDF] HP Elite Series 800 G9 Desktops PCs](https://h20195.www2.hp.com/v2/GetPDF.aspx/c08017769.pdf#:~:text=HP%20800%20G9%20TWR%2FSFF%20desktops,Gen%20processor%20to%20support))L27„Äë). HP typically supports business desktops for ~3+ years of BIOS updates and 5+ years of parts/service. The Elite Mini‚Äôs BIOS is feature-rich (with vPro/AMT controls, device whitelisting, etc.) and HP has a track record of maintaining enterprise features across OS updates. In short, **firmware longevity is a strong point** ‚Äì this mini will receive updates well into its lifecycle, aligning with corporate IT requirements.

This gives the Tiny a unique choice: a high-power current desktop CPU or a cutting-edge low-power SoC. The **Lunar Lake Ultra 7** brings new CPU core IP (IPC gains over Meteor/Raptor) and significantly reduces power, making the M90q Gen5 one of the first desktops with true mobile SoC internals.  
- **iGPU:** Varies by CPU choice. The 14700 uses Intel UHD 770 (Gen12), while the **Core Ultra 7 258V** features an integrated **Arc GPU (Intel Xe)**. Specifically, the 258V has the new **Intel Arc ‚Äú140V‚Äù iGPU** ‚Äì a next-gen graphics core with improved Alchemist-derived archite ([Intel Core Ultra 7 258V Processor - Benchmarks and Specs - NotebookCheck.net Tech](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Core-Ultra-7-258V-Processor-Benchmarks-and-Specs.892883.0.html#:~:text=The%20Intel%20Core%20Ultra%205,support%20are%20included%20as%20well))-L44„Äë. This iGPU likely has 8~10 Xe cores (exact specs TBD), offering much stronger graphics than UHD 770 and even outclassing Meteor Lake‚Äôs Xe-LPG. It supports advanced graphics features and is paired with the chip‚Äôs on-package LPDDR5X for high bandwidth. In short, the Lunar Lake config turns the Tiny into a mini PC with graphics on par with Intel‚Äôs latest ultrabooks (and an order of magnitude better GPU than the older UHD found in the Raptor config).  
- **Platform & Features:** The ThinkCentre M90q Gen5 in its **Core Ultra** configuration is essentially a desktop in an ultrabook‚Äôs clothing. The **Lunar Lake** SoC is fully loaded: it uses **Foveros** packaging like Meteor Lake and comes with **Thunderbolt¬†4**, **PCIe¬†5.0** for SSD, and **CNVi Wi-Fi¬†7 + BT 5.4** support bui ([Intel Core Ultra 7 258V Processor - Benchmarks and Specs - NotebookCheck.net Tech](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Core-Ultra-7-258V-Processor-Benchmarks-and-Specs.892883.0.html#:~:text=The%20Intel%20Core%20Ultra%205,support%20are%20included%20as%20well))-L69„Äë.

By contrast, the standard desktop config (14700 + Q chipset) has PCIe5 and vPro, but no integrated NPU or Wi-Fi7 (it relies on a separate NIC and has older USB 3.2/TB options). **Lenovo‚Äôs design** here is forward-thinking: the M90q Gen5 Tiny can be an efficient AI-enabled client (with the Ultra 7 SoC) or a traditional powerful mini workstation (with the desktop CPU). In either case, it targets enterprise use with features like TPM¬†2.0, vPro management (supported on both 14700 and some Core Ultra models with vPro Enterprise), and multiple monitor outputs.  
- **Roadmap Position:** With the **Core Ultra 7 258V**, the M90q Gen5 is **‚ÄúNext-Gen Ready.‚Äù** Lunar Lake represents Intel‚Äôs next big step for laptops in 2025, and Lenovo bringing it to a Tiny desktop means this model is ahead of the curve. That configuration is using **15th Gen Core technology** before most desktops see it. It will remain relevant longer, as those Lion Cove/Skymont cores won‚Äôt be superseded until Intel‚Äôs 16th Gen (*Panther Lake*, ~2026). The standard 14700 version is current-gen (2024) but not future-proof. Therefore, the ThinkCentre Gen5 covers both ends ‚Äì but notably, Lenovo advertising a Core Ultra option indicates this Tiny is *built with future tech in mind*. By 2027, a 258V-powered unit will still be serviceable (albeit probably due for replacement then), whereas older-gen Tiny PCs would already be two steps behind.  
- **Future-Standards Readiness:** **USB4 v2 / Thunderbolt¬†5:** The Lunar Lake variant has TB4 (like Meteor); TB5 (80¬†Gbps) will likely debut in later Intel 15th/16th gen ‚Äì so not in this model. That said, with multiple TB4 ports it‚Äôs ready for high-speed docks and eGPUs today. **DDR6:** Not supported; the Lunar chip‚Äôs on-package memory is LPDDR5X, which trades upgradeability for performance. By 2027 DDR6 might appear in high-end workstations, but this Tiny will stick with DDR5-class memory. **Wi-Fi¬†7:** The platform is explicitly ready ‚Äì Lenovo notes support for up to Wi-Fi¬†7 on the M90q3-L5„Äë. Likely, units will ship with Wi-Fi¬†6E initially, but antennas and CNVi interface can handle an upgrade to an Intel AX411 (Wi-Fi¬†7) module. **AI acceleration:** with the NPU, it‚Äôs equipped for the coming wave of local AI workflows (e.g. Teams background effects, AI noise suppression, etc.) that future Windows releases will leverage. In summary, this ThinkCentre is **uncommonly future-proof** for a business PC ‚Äì especially in the Core Ultra configuration, which adopts next-gen memory packaging and AI features early.  
- **BIOS/Firmware Support:** **Lenovo‚Äôs ThinkCentre** line is enterprise-focused, meaning long-term BIOS support and stable image platforms. IT departments can expect BIOS updates for security for 4‚Äì5 years. Lenovo will support both CPU configurations fully (likely with different BIOS branches). For the Core Ultra models, firmware will handle the new SoC ‚Äì including updates for the NPU and on-die RAM training. Given Lenovo‚Äôs history, the M90q Gen5 Tiny will receive regular BIOS/UEFI fixes, vPro updates, and even feature updates (e.g. adding BIOS options for new devices) during its life. Lenovo also has a track record of enabling next-gen CPU support on the same motherboard when possible (though with BGA SoCs that‚Äôs not applicable here). All told, **firmware longevity is assured**; plus, any early issues with the new Core Ultra platform will be addressed through Lenovo‚Äôs updates in coordination with Intel. This level of support makes the ‚Äúnext-gen‚Äù Tiny a safer bet in enterprise environments despite its advanced tech.

## Laptops

### Dell XPS 14 (9440) ‚Äì *Core Ultra 7¬†155H* ‚Äì üü¢ **Current Gen**  
- **CPU Generation:** **Intel Core Ultra 7¬†155H**, part of Intel‚Äôs 14th Gen **Meteor Lake** family (launched in late 2023 for laptops). It‚Äôs a 16-core hybrid CPU (6 Performance + 8 Efficient + 2 LP-efficient cores) similar to the 165H, but binned slightly ([Intel Core Ultra "Meteor Lake" Processor Lineup Overview | TechPowerUp Forums](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/intel-core-ultra-meteor-lake-processor-lineup-overview.316756/#:~:text=The%20Core%20Ultra%207%20155H,capable%20VRM%20and%20cooling%20solution))-L212„Äë.

In practice, this new iGPU roughly doubles the 3D performance of Intel‚Äôs previous Iris Xe (96 EU) graphics ‚Äì meaning light gaming and GPU compute tasks are very fe5-L30„Äë. The XPS¬†14 9440 in some configs also includes an NVIDIA RTX¬†4050, but even on the iGPU alone, it supports 4K media editing, multiple 6K displays, AV1 hardware encode, and has modern features (mesh shading, sampler feedback) inherited from Arc. It‚Äôs a **current-gen GPU** that will be supported by Intel‚Äôs unified Arc graphics driver going forward.  
- **Platform & Features:** The XPS¬†14 is one of the first ultrabooks with **Meteor Lake‚Äôs advanced platform**. It has **LPDDR5X-6400** memory (soldered) for high bandwidth at low power. The SoC tile integrates **Thunderbolt¬†4/USB4** ports (the XPS has two TB4 USB-C ports) for versatile connectivity. A notable feature is the on-chip **NPU (Neural Processing Unit)** ‚Äì Meteor Lake‚Äôs Gen3 NPU can run AI tasks (like camera effects, voice dictation, background blur) with minimal CPU intervention. Intel rates the whole-package AI at **~34¬†TOPS** on the top  ([Intel Core Ultra "Meteor Lake" Processor Lineup Overview | TechPowerUp Forums](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/intel-core-ultra-meteor-lake-processor-lineup-overview.316756/#:~:text=23%20On%20all%20processor%20models%2C,for%20the%20top%20processor%20model))-L230„Äë, so the 155H is slightly under that ‚Äì still tens of TOPS of AI performance available. This is leveraged in Dell‚Äôs software for video calls (Dell Optimizer uses the NPU for presence detection, auto framing, etc.). The **SoC tile** also provides advanced media engines (Quick Sync with AV1) and support for **Wi-Fi¬†6E/7** via companion module. Dell ships the XPS 14 with Wi-Fi¬†6E by default, but the platform is ready for Wi-Fi¬†7 modules when they become available. Overall, the XPS¬†14‚Äôs platform is **Intel‚Äôs current state-of-the-art** for mobility: disaggregated chip, AI capabilities, and robust I/O in a power-efficient package.  
- **Roadmap Position:** The XPS¬†14 (9440) is firmly **current-gen** (2024) in Intel‚Äôs roadmap. Meteor Lake is the latest architecture for notebooks, and being an XPS, this laptop was a launch vehicle for those new features. It will remain high-end through 2025. By 2026, Intel‚Äôs 15th Gen (Arrow/Lunar) will take over in premium laptops, but given the incremental nature of those (Arrow Lake will improve CPU/GPU, Lunar Lake targets lower power segments), a Meteor Lake laptop from 2024 won‚Äôt feel obsolete until at least two generations out. So through 2027, an i7-155H with its NPU and PCIe5 support will still hold up decently. It‚Äôs *not* next-gen beyond today‚Äôs tech, but it‚Äôs a **flagship of the current generation**, ensuring a decent runway.  
- **Future-Standards Readiness:** The XPS¬†14 covers most emerging standards *except* those not yet launched. **Thunderbolt¬†5** is not here (expected in future Intel chips), but dual TB4 ports offer 40¬†Gbps each which is plenty for current docks/egpus. **USB4 v2 (80¬†Gbps)** isn‚Äôt supported ‚Äì that spec will likely coincide with TB5. **DDR6**: No, it uses LPDDR5X; DDR6 will be post-2025 in the PC space. **Wi-Fi¬†7**: The platform is ready, and Dell could offer a Wi-Fi¬†7 card upgrade when Intel‚Äôs modules mature ‚Äì so the laptop can be upgraded to Wi-Fi¬†7, but the initial configs are Wi-Fi¬†6E (6¬†GHz, 160¬†MHz). In short, Meteor Lake in XPS 14 was designed with **some future-proofing** (PCIe5 SSD slot, NPU, optional WWAN, etc.), but truly next-gen standards like TB5 will come with its successor. Still, an owner of this laptop in 2025‚Äì2026 won‚Äôt miss out on much; it‚Äôs equipped for the foreseeable tech (except perhaps the extreme bandwidth of next-gen external GPUs or very high refresh 8K displays, which TB5 would handle).  
- **BIOS/Firmware Support:** **Dell XPS** laptops have a solid support record, though not as lengthy as Dell‚Äôs Latitude line. Expect BIOS updates for at least a couple of years to iron out early Meteor Lake issues (e.g. power management tuning, Thunderbolt firmware updates) and to add support for new devices (Dell often adds BIOS support for new USB-C docks, etc.). The XPS 14 being a first-gen Meteor product likely saw several BIOS revisions early on to optimize the NPU scheduling and GPU drivers. Dell will also issue firmware updates for security (Intel Platform Trust, BIOS passwords, etc. ‚Äì important for a prosumer machine). Typically, around 3‚Äì4 years out, updates slow down. By 2027, official BIOS support may end, but by then the platform will have matured. Enterprise IT features (vPro is not on XPS consumer models) are limited, but Dell does provide driver packs for OS reinstallation and uses the standard Intel driver sets, which will continue to get updates (especially GPU drivers via Arc control panel). Overall, owners can expect a **reliable firmware lifecycle**, albeit shorter than a ThinkPad X1 or HP EliteBook would get.

### Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 ‚Äì *Core Ultra 7¬†258V* ‚Äì üîµ **Next-Gen Ready**  
- **CPU Generation:** **Intel Core Ultra 7¬†258V**, a cutting-edge 15th Gen Core processor (likely **Lunar Lake**, expected late 2024/2025) often referenced with Lenovo‚Äôs X1 Carbon Gen 13. It‚Äôs an **8-core (4P + 4E)** SoC designed for ultralights, and notably **none of its cores use hyper-threading** ‚Äì a departure from pri51-L59„Äë. The P-cores are the new **‚ÄúLion Cove‚Äù** architecture and E-cores are **‚ÄúSkymont‚Äù**, delivering significant IPC uplifts (Intel touted ~14% IPC gain for Lion Cove vs Redwood Cove, and massive 60%+ for Skymont vs Gra51-L59„Äë. The 258V runs at up to ~4.8¬†GHz on  ([Intel Core Ultra 7 258V Processor - Benchmarks and Specs - NotebookCheck.net Tech](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Core-Ultra-7-258V-Processor-Benchmarks-and-Specs.892883.0.html#:~:text=The%20Intel%20Core%20Ultra%205,support%20are%20included%20as%20well))39-L44„Äë, and being a ThinkPad X1, it‚Äôs tuned for efficiency first. This CPU launched with on-package memory, enabling a thinner laptop design. In context, the Core¬†7¬†258V is *next-gen* for 2025 ‚Äì one of Intel‚Äôs first 3¬†nm client CPUs and likely to be among the fastest chips for premium ultraportables upon release.  
- **iGPU:** **Intel Arc ‚Äú140V‚Äù GPU** integrated on  ([Intel Core Ultra 7 258V Processor - Benchmarks and Specs - NotebookCheck.net Tech](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Core-Ultra-7-258V-Processor-Benchmarks-and-Specs.892883.0.html#:~:text=The%20Intel%20Core%20Ultra%205,support%20are%20included%20as%20well))39-L44„Äë. This is a next-generation Xe architecture (likely Alchemist/Battlemage hybrid) optimized for low power. It comes with substantial graphics horsepower ‚Äì early info suggests 8 Xe cores (like Meteor) but possibly at higher clocks, or even a 10th Xe core enabled due to on-package RAM providing sufficient bandwidth. Lenovo‚Äôs spec highlights this iGPU can drive multiple 4K displays and handle creative workloads smoothly. It‚Äôs essentially bringing discrete-level media and compute features into the ultraportable space. Compared to previous X1 Carbons (which had Iris Xe 96EU), this Arc 140V is a large step up ‚Äì it supports advanced AI-enhanced graphics and could even do light gaming at 1080p better than any prior X1‚Äôs integrated graphics.  
- **Platform & Features:** The X1 Carbon Gen 13 with Core Ultra is a showcase of Intel‚Äôs **Lunar Lake platform innovations**. Key features include: **On-Package Memory** ‚Äì it has **32¬†GB LPDDR5X-8533** soldered within the CPU  ([Intel Core Ultra 7 258V Processor - Benchmarks and Specs - NotebookCheck.net Tech](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Core-Ultra-7-258V-Processor-Benchmarks-and-Specs.892883.0.html#:~:text=The%20Intel%20Core%20Ultra%205,support%20are%20included%20as%20well))39-L44„Äë, drastically increasing memory bandwidth and efficiency (at the cost of upgradeability). This approach, similar to Apple‚Äôs M-series, reduces memory latency and improves integrated GPU performance. The SoC provides **PCIe¬†5.0** support (for the SSD slot) and native **Thunderbolt¬†4**/USB4 ports. Networking-wise, it natively supports **Wi-Fi¬†7 (802.11be)** and Bluetooth 5.4 via Intel‚Äôs latest CNVi61-L69„Äë ‚Äì the X1C13 is advertised with Wi-Fi¬†7 capability. Crucially, Lunar Lake brings an upgraded **NPU**: Intel‚Äôs **AI Boost Gen4 engine** with about **47¬†TOPS** perf ([Intel Core Ultra 7 258V Processor - Benchmarks and Specs - NotebookCheck.net Tech](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Core-Ultra-7-258V-Processor-Benchmarks-and-Specs.892883.0.html#:~:text=The%20Intel%20Core%20Ultra%205,support%20are%20included%20as%20well))39-L44„Äë. This NPU can handle heavy AI workloads (e.g. local ML inference for Office copilot, AI noise suppression) entirely on-platform. The ThinkPad X1 line likely integrates this with Lenovo‚Äôs Commercial Vantage software for enhanced security (AI threat detection, etc.). Security-wise, as a ThinkPad, it has TPM 2.0, IR camera with human presence detection (leveraging the NPU for ultra-low power processing), and vPro (for relevant CPU SKU, possibly available since Core¬†7¬†258V is a U-series aimed at commercial use). All told, the Gen¬†13 X1 Carbon is built on a **‚Äúnext-gen‚Äù Intel platform** that leaps ahead in memory tech and AI capabilities, while retaining the business features (MIL-spec durability, globally available service) of ThinkPads.  
- **Roadmap Position:** The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 is among the **first of Intel‚Äôs 15th Gen Core** laptops, making it **Next-Gen Ready** by definition. It adopts Lunar Lake likely even before Intel‚Äôs mainstream 15th-gen (Arrow Lake) hits larger notebooks. Through 2027, this Gen13 X1 will age gracefully ‚Äì its CPU architecture will be succeeded by Panther Lake (~2026/27), but the differences will be iterative. Importantly, it already has features (like an advanced NPU and on-die RAM) that many PCs won‚Äôt get until a later cycle, so it‚Äôs somewhat ahead of the curve. Lenovo‚Äôs roadmap for the X1 family suggests Gen14+ will continue with refinements (perhaps Panther Lake on 18A process by 2026), but Gen13 owners will still have a very capable machine in a few years. In summary, this model is positioned as a **forward-looking flagship**, likely to be supported and relevant until at least 2027 before a major jump in tech (like say, quantum computing or entirely new memory types) might prompt a replacement.  
- **Future-Standards Readiness:** The X1 Carbon Gen 13 covers most upcoming standards: it‚Äôs explicitly ready for **Wi-Fi¬†7** (up to 320¬†MHz channels, 6¬†GHz band) which is just rolling out in 2024‚Äì25. It has **Thunderbolt¬†4** ‚Äì while not TB5, TB4 at 40¬†Gbps will serve for current use; TB5 peripherals (when they arrive in 2025‚Äì26) would need a future model to fully utilize, but TB4 ports remain backward- and forward-compatible (just at lower max bandwidth). **USB4 v2** (the USB 80¬†Gbps mode) isn‚Äôt supported on this generation ‚Äì we expect that with TB5 on later Intel chips. **DDR6:** The on-package LPDDR5X is state-of-the-art now; DDR6 isn‚Äôt expected in laptops until maybe 2027+, so this X1 will likely be replaced by the time DDR6 is relevant. One area of note: the 32¬†GB fixed RAM may be a limitation for some future uses (no upgrade path), but 32¬†GB is generous for a 2024 ultrabook and will suffice for most workloads through the laptop‚Äôs life. The presence of a powerful NPU means it‚Äôs ready for **AI-centric future software** (Windows 11/12 is increasingly AI-optimized ‚Äì this hardware can run features locally that others might offload to cloud). In sum, the Gen13 X1 is **built with emerging standards in mind** (especially in connectivity and AI), missing only the bleeding-edge TB5 which wasn‚Äôt available yet. It‚Äôs one of the most future-proof designs in the 2024 laptop lineup.  
- **BIOS/Firmware Support:** **Lenovo ThinkPad** support is among the best in the industry. The X1 Carbon Gen 13 will receive frequent BIOS updates, particularly since it‚Äôs introducing new tech (on-package RAM and a new NPU ‚Äì Lenovo will fine-tune power management and address any early quirks). Lenovo typically provides BIOS/UEFI updates for ~5 years on X1 models, and even beyond for critical security patches. As a vPro platform, it will get firmware patches aligned with Intel‚Äôs enterprise schedule. Enterprises deploying this X1 can standardize on it knowing BIOS stability and updates will be delivered (Lenovo often fixes issues like Thunderbolt dock compatibility or adds PXE boot improvements via BIOS updates). Driver support via Lenovo‚Äôs System Update will keep the NPU and GPU drivers up-to-date; since the iGPU is Arc-based, Intel‚Äôs Arc driver team will push frequent graphics updates that Lenovo validates. The X1‚Äôs firmware also includes business-centric features (Configurable TDP, battery thresholds, etc.) that Lenovo will refine over time. Overall, buyers of the Gen13 X1 can expect **long-term firmware support and reliability**, making the ‚Äúnext-gen‚Äù hardware a safe investment.

### HP EliteBook Ultra 14 G1¬†**i** ‚Äì *Core Ultra 7¬†155H* ‚Äì üü¢ **Current Gen**  
- **CPU Generation:** **Intel Core Ultra 7¬†155H** (Meteor Lake, 14th Gen) ‚Äì the same 6P+8E+2LP architecture described earlier for th ([Intel Core Ultra "Meteor Lake" Processor Lineup Overview | TechPowerUp Forums](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/intel-core-ultra-meteor-lake-processor-lineup-overview.316756/#:~:text=The%20Core%20Ultra%207%20155H,capable%20VRM%20and%20cooling%20solution))04-L212„Äë. In the EliteBook Ultra 14 G1i, this CPU is tuned for enterprise: it likely supports **Intel vPro Enterprise** (manageability features) given the ‚Äúi‚Äù designation (HP often uses ‚ÄúG1¬†i‚Äù to denote Intel versions with vPro, as opposed to AMD or non-vPro). Running at up to 4.8‚ÄØGHz on the ([Intel Core Ultra "Meteor Lake" Processor Lineup Overview | TechPowerUp Forums](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/intel-core-ultra-meteor-lake-processor-lineup-overview.316756/#:~:text=The%20Core%20Ultra%207%20155H,capable%20VRM%20and%20cooling%20solution))04-L212„Äë, it provides ample performance for productivity, and the efficient cores + low-power island cores give it outstanding idle battery life ‚Äì a key for an ‚ÄúUltra‚Äù business laptop. This CPU is **current-gen Intel** (the latest in 2024) and brings AI and efficiency improvements that business IT can leverage (better virtualization performance, Thread Director improvements for Windows 11, etc.).  
- **iGPU:** **Intel Arc Xe iGPU (8 Xe cores)** ‚Äì identical to what‚Äôs in the Dell XPS 155H config. It provides significantly improved graphics for an EliteBook class device. Previous-gen EliteBooks with integrated graphics used Iris Xe (96 EU), so moving to Arc Xe (128 EU) is a boon for any graphics-intensive tasks like data visualization, CAD previews, or simply driving multiple high-res monitors. The EliteBook Ultra 14 G1i can also be configured with Intel‚Äôs **Intel 185H** (Core Ultra 9) or a discrete GPU in some variants, but the base Ultra¬†7 offers plenty for typical business workloads. This iGPU also supports *Intel Quick Sync AI* enhancements ‚Äì for example, it can use the GPU for AI-based noise suppression in meetings, complementing the NPU.  
- **Platform & Features:** As a member of HP‚Äôs **EliteBook** family, the Ultra 14 G1i blends Meteor Lake‚Äôs new features with HP‚Äôs business-class hardware. The laptop has **Thunderbolt¬†4** USB-C ports for docking (HP‚Äôs Thunderbolt docks will work seamlessly). It supports **LPDDR5X memory** (for power savings in an ultraportable form factor) ‚Äì likely 32¬†GB max, soldered, at 6400¬†MT/s or higher. The inclusion of **Intel‚Äôs NPU** means the EliteBook can offload AI tasks (HP‚Äôs conferencing apps, or Microsoft Teams, can use the NPU for things like background blur without hammering the CPU). HP also integrates security features at BIOS level ‚Äì the Sure Start BIOS protection and Sure Sense (which could leverage the NPU for threat detection, as it‚Äôs essentially an AI accelerator). The **vPro Enterprise** support ensures full remote management and security compliance (the 155H, when in the vPro version, allows for Intel AMT). Additionally, being an ‚ÄúUltra‚Äù model, it likely has a high-quality 14-inch screen, IR camera, and presence detection (which again uses the NPU for ultra-low-power sensing of user presence). In summary, the Ultra 14 G1i‚Äôs platform is **Meteor Lake with enterprise polish**: AI, TB4, Wi-Fi¬†6E (upgradeable to 7), and robust security/management firmware.  
- **Roadmap Position:** This EliteBook is a **current-gen business laptop** (2024). HP‚Äôs roadmap typically follows Intel‚Äôs: G1 with 12th Gen (Alder), G2 with 13th, now G1 ‚Äúi‚Äù appears to align with 14th Gen Meteor. It‚Äôs at the forefront for HP in 2024. Over the next couple of years, we‚Äôll see G2i (probably Arrow Lake) and G3i (Panther Lake) if Intel‚Äôs schedule holds ‚Äì each bringing new features like TB5 or DDR6 perhaps. However, the G1i with Meteor will remain viable in enterprise fleets for 3‚Äì5 years. It‚Äôs one generation behind Intel‚Äôs absolute newest (by late 2025, Arrow Lake laptops might be out), but not enough to call it old. Essentially, it‚Äôs **current generation** and will be supported as such by HP through its lifecycle. Enterprises refreshing in 2024 with this model can be confident it won‚Äôt be outdated until it‚Äôs time for their next refresh (usually ~3 years).  
- **Future-Standards Readiness:** Being a 2024 machine, it has some, but not all, upcoming standards. **Thunderbolt¬†5:** Not present; HP will likely introduce that in a later G2 or G3 model when Intel integrates it. Nonetheless, TB4 (40¬†Gbps) on this laptop supports dual 4K monitors and high-speed peripherals well ‚Äì only extremely bandwidth-hungry future devices (like 8K VR headsets or multi-8K monitor setups) would demand TB5. **USB4 v2:** not supported (ties into TB5 timeline). **Wi-Fi¬†7:** The Intel wireless chipset in early 2024 is AX211 (Wi-Fi¬†6E); Intel‚Äôs Wi-Fi¬†7 (e.g., AX411) might be offered as an upgrade in late 2024. The laptop‚Äôs antennas and motherboard can handle Wi-Fi¬†7, so it is *upgradable* to Wi-Fi¬†7 (HP often sells newer WLAN modules as spare parts for compatibility). **DDR6:** Not in this generation ‚Äì it uses LPDDR5X; DDR6 likely won‚Äôt hit business laptops until ~2026+. **NPU & AI:** It *is* ready for the increasing AI integration in software ‚Äì an advantage over any -1 gen platform (which had no NPU). In short, the EliteBook Ultra G1i is well-equipped for the near future (especially in connectivity with TB4 and potential Wi-Fi7), but truly next-gen hardware changes (like TB5, DDR6) will come in subsequent generations. HP balanced cutting-edge with proven tech here, leaning slightly conservative to ensure reliability.  
- **BIOS/Firmware Support:** **HP EliteBook** line is known for its comprehensive BIOS and security updates. The ‚ÄúUltra‚Äù is a new sub-series, but it inherits the Elite family‚Äôs ethos. Expect HP to provide BIOS updates for at least 3‚Äì5 years, including their **Sure Start** self-healing BIOS protection (which automatically restores the BIOS if corrupted). HP collaborates with Intel on vPro, so AMT firmware will be updated as needed (for example, to patch manageability or ME firmware issues). HP‚Äôs BIOS likely includes many configurable options (TPM, Secure Boot, Thunderbolt security levels, etc.), and they will issue updates to maintain compatibility (e.g., with new docks, new OS versions ‚Äì historically HP adds Windows WhQL fixes via BIOS). Given this is one of HP‚Äôs first Meteor Lake laptops, early BIOS updates will fine-tune the NPU usage and power management ‚Äì HP has a track record of quickly releasing fixes for any CPU whine, fan curve issues, or resume-from-sleep problems via BIOS patches. In sum, corporate customers can expect **long-term, stable firmware support** on the G1i, typical of HP‚Äôs Elite lineup, ensuring the device stays secure and efficient throughout its deployment.

In practice, this is the most powerful integrated GPU in any 14-inch laptop in 2024. It can handle many games at 1080p low/medium or act as a robust GPU for content creation when the discrete NVIDIA GPU is idle. Notably, in the Zephyrus G14, there is also a discrete GPU (e.g., GeForce RTX¬†4070), but the Radeon 890M works for hybrid graphics and when running on battery. It supports FreeSync, AV1 encode/decode, and has feature parity with AMD‚Äôs Radeon RX 7000 dGPUs (being RDNA3-family).  
- **Platform & Features:** The Ryzen AI¬†9 HX370 is a **monolithic SoC** packed with next-gen features. It offers **PCIe¬†4.0** lanes for a discrete GPU and SSDs (Zen5 mobile sticks to PCIe4, prioritizing efficiency over PCIe5‚Äôs extra bandwidth).

This is branded as ‚ÄúRyzen AI 300 Series‚Äù NPU, and it enables things like real-time video enhancement, AI audio processing, and can be used by Microsoft‚Äôs Windows Studio Effects just like Intel‚Äôs NPUs. For I/O, the HX370 platform has **USB4 (40¬†Gbps)** ports ‚Äì in the G14, these appear as two USB4 Type-C that support DisplayPort 2.1 and power delivery. While AMD‚Äôs USB4 doesn‚Äôt carry the Thunderbolt branding, it can similarly tunnel PCIe  ([AMD Announces Ryzen 7040 "Phoenix Point" Mobile Processor: 4nm, Zen 4, RDNA3, XDNA | TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/303022/amd-announces-ryzen-7040-phoenix-point-mobile-processor-4nm-zen-4-rdna3-xdna#:~:text=discrete%20GPUs,acceleration%20and%20display%20engines))‚Ä†L67-L75„Äë. Other features include an upgraded media engine (AV1 hardware encode is new on this generation) and support for **Wi-Fi¬†6E/7** via external MediaTek or Qualcomm modules (the G14 comes with Wi-Fi¬†6E; Wi-Fi¬†7 modules for AMD will likely arrive later). The Zephyrus G14, being a gaming laptop, also implements AMD‚Äôs SmartShift (dynamic power sharing between CPU/GPU) and Smart Access Memory (resizable BAR) if paired with an AMD dGPU in some configurations. Essentially, this G14‚Äôs platform is **AMD‚Äôs current best** for laptops: Zen5 CPU, RDNA3.5 iGPU, and a solid I/O and AI feature set to carry it forward.  
- **Roadmap Position:** The 2024 Zephyrus G14 (GA403) with Ryzen¬†9 HX370 is at the **leading edge of AMD‚Äôs roadmap**. Zen5 is the newest CPU core, and RDNA3.5 is an intermediate graphics update ahead of RDNA4 (expected in late 2024/2025 for GPUs). AMD‚Äôs next CPU generation (Zen6) won‚Äôt arrive until ~2026, so this laptop‚Äôs CPU will remain **‚Äúcurrent-gen‚Äù for a good while**. By 2027, it will be two generations old (with Zen6 and possibly Zen7 in play), but in 2025 it‚Äôs top-tier. We tag it as **Current Gen** for AMD, since there‚Äôs nothing beyond Zen5 in the market yet. The G14‚Äôs specific hardware is somewhat future-proof (thanks to the AI engine and USB4), so it won‚Äôt feel dated quickly. Gamers and creators using this machine through the next 2‚Äì3 years will find it keeping pace with software demands, while more incremental improvements (like Zen5+ or a Zen5 refresh) might come, those will likely be modest.  
- **Future-Standards Readiness:** The GA403 platform covers the present but not the very latest upcoming standards. For example, **Thunderbolt¬†5** is not supported (Intel tech, and AMD‚Äôs USB4 tops out at 40¬†Gbps). **USB4 v2 (80¬†Gbps)** ‚Äì AMD‚Äôs Strix Point does not integrate USB4 12‚Ä†L1-L4„Äë. So external I/O bandwidth is limited to current-gen USB4/TB4 levels. **DDR6:** No ‚Äì it uses LPDDR5X; DDR6 is a few years away. **Wi-Fi¬†7:** Not in the shipping model (comes with Wi-Fi¬†6E), but presumably can be upgraded if a compatible module is available (the USB4 ports and motherboard would support the bandwidth needed for Wi-Fi¬†7 cards when they arrive). Where it *is* next-gen ready is the AI engine: at 50¬†TOPS, it‚Äôs on par with or better than Intel‚Äôs 2024 offerings and will support new AI-driven OS features in Windows 11/12. Additionally, the G14‚Äôs USB4 ports support **DisplayPort¬†2.1** output (thanks to RDNA3.5‚Äôs display engine) ‚Äì meaning it could drive future high-resolution, high-refresh monitors that older laptops cannot. Overall, while the core I/O standards are **current-gen**, not next-gen, this laptop won‚Äôt be left behind in functionality. The main gap might be for users who, a couple of years down the line, want to use a Thunderbolt¬†5 storage or dock ‚Äì this AMD machine wouldn‚Äôt support the full speed. But for the laptop‚Äôs lifespan (2024‚Äì2027), it‚Äôs aligned with the ecosystem of devices (which are mostly TB4/USB4).  
- **BIOS/Firmware Support:** **ASUS ROG** laptops get regular BIOS updates especially in the first 1‚Äì2 years to optimize performance. For the 2024 G14, ASUS has likely issued updates to improve compatibility with newer RAM, fix any USB4 docking quirks, and enhance fan curves or GPU switching behavior. However, being a consumer gaming line, the G14 won‚Äôt have the long-tail BIOS support that business laptops do. Expect perhaps 2‚Äì3 years of firmware updates; beyond that, critical fixes might still come if needed, but feature updates will not. ASUS does provide driver updates via MyASUS and Armoury Crate for a while, and AMD‚Äôs GPU drivers (for the iGPU) will be updated alongside their graphics cards, which is a plus. The Zephyrus also relies on AMD for things like AGESA (the firmware code for the CPU); AMD has been reasonably good at providing AGESA updates to fix issues (for example, USB4 reliability improvements) and ASUS packages those into BIOS releases. On the flip side, the G14‚Äôs firmware is tuned for gaming performance ‚Äì users have less ability to tweak pro features (no vPro or ECC or such). Historically, ASUS supports each ROG model with BIOS updates up until ~the next two generations are out. Thus, by around 2026, BIOS updates may taper off as focus shifts to newer models. In summary, **firmware support is decent but not enterprise-grade**: you‚Äôll get enough updates to keep the machine stable and optimized during its prime, but don‚Äôt expect decade-long security maintenance. Enthusiast communities do often mod BIOS or share tweaks for these ASUS laptops if needed down the line.

### Razer Blade 14 (2024) ‚Äì *Ryzen 9¬†8945HS* ‚Äì üü° **Previous Gen**

Essentially, the 8945HS is a frequency-tweaked Phoenix chip; architecturally it‚Äôs the same Zen¬†4 core (TSMC 4¬†nm). AMD did improve the **Ryzen AI** engine slightly on Hawk Point (more firmware optimization, increasing AI throughput from ~10¬†TOPS to ~16¬†TOPS for the NPU, and ~39¬†TOPS total SOC AI capability when counting GPU acc ([Intel Core Ultra "Meteor Lake" Processor Lineup Overview | TechPowerUp Forums](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/intel-core-ultra-meteor-lake-processor-lineup-overview.316756/#:~:text=23%20On%20all%20processor%20models%2C,for%20the%20top%20processor%20model))L223-L230„Äë. In the Blade 14 (2024 model), this CPU provides top-tier performance for its size, but since AMD‚Äôs Zen5 mobile is now out (Ryzen AI¬†300 series), the 8945HS is technically **one generation behind** the latest. We mark it as *Previous Gen*. It‚Äôs still an extremely capable processor in 2024, outperforming many 13th-gen Intel chips in multithreaded tasks, but it lacks the architectural and efficiency gains of Zen5.

While the Blade 14 pairs the CPU with a powerful NVIDIA GPU (RTX 4070/4080 depending on config), the 780M iGPU is used for battery-saving graphics (AMD Switchable Graphics). It‚Äôs one of the fastest iGPUs of 2023, capable of ~GTX¬†1650 Max-Q level performance on its own. It supports features like Radeon Super Resolution and can even game modestly at 720p‚Äì1080p when the discrete GPU is off. Compared to newer RDNA3.5 iGPUs (like in HX370), the 780M is a step behind in raw performance and lacks some minor feature refinements, but it‚Äôs still fully DirectX¬†12 Ultimate compliant. Importantly for the Blade, the iGPU enables **USB4/DisplayPort output** and video encode when the NVIDIA GPU is inactive. It does not have any AI cores, but it benefits from general GPU compute for AI if needed.  
- **Platform & Features:** The Blade 14 (2024) leverages the AMD **7040/8040 ‚ÄúPhoenix‚Äù platform**. This means **PCIe¬†4.0** support (the RTX¬†40 dGPU runs on PCIe4 x8, and the SSD is PCIe4 x4).

The 8945HS includes the **first-gen XDNA AI engine**, which in this machine can accelerate certain Windows AI features (though software support is still nascent). IO-wise, the Blade 14 has a good array: USB4 Type-Cs, USB¬†3.2 Gen2 Type-As, HDMI¬†2.1 for external monitor (wired to the NVIDIA GPU). It supports Wi-Fi¬†6E out of the box (Killer/Intel NIC). One notable platform feature is AMD‚Äôs **SmartShift Eco** ‚Äì the Blade 14 can automatically power down the RTX GPU and use the 780M when on battery, a seamless switch that extends battery life. This is enabled by the platform‚Äôs PCIe bifurcation and USB4 display capabilities. Overall, the Blade 14‚Äôs platform is **high-end 2023 tech** ‚Äì robust and well-balanced, but lacking the new bells and whistles introduced in 2024 by Intel and AMD‚Äôs next gens.  
- **Roadmap Position:** The 2024 Blade 14 launched just before AMD‚Äôs Zen5 laptops, so it sits at an interesting point. It‚Äôs **one generation behind AMD‚Äôs latest** mobile CPU (Zen4 vs Zen5), so we label it previous-gen. Through 2025, it will remain a strong performer, but by 2026 it will be two generations old (since Zen6 APUs might debut by then). Razer tends to refresh the Blade 14 annually with the newest AMD CPU, so the 2025 Blade 14 will likely move to Zen5. That said, owners of the 2024 model will not immediately be left in the dust ‚Äì Zen5 Strix brings maybe ~15% IPC uplift and AI improvements, but real-world difference might be moderate for gaming. By 2027, however, this Zen4-based system will definitely feel its age in efficiency and AI features compared to newer machines. It‚Äôs *not* next-gen ready, but it was the pinnacle of the outgoing generation.  
- **Future-Standards Readiness:** The Blade 14 (8945HS) mostly covers current standards and skips upcoming ones: **USB4 v2 / TB5:** Not supported; it sticks to USB4 40¬†Gbps. For most users, that‚Äôs fine (supports external GPUs, fast SSDs, etc.), but it won‚Äôt reach the 80‚Äì120¬†Gbps of next-gen ports. **DDR6:** Not applicable; DDR5 will be the norm throughout this device‚Äôs life. The choice of socketed DDR5 means it trades off the higher speeds of LPDDR5X ‚Äì in a way, it‚Äôs slightly less future-proof in memory bandwidth, but more so in capacity (you could install 64¬†GB if needed later). **Wi-Fi¬†7:** Not included ‚Äì Razer‚Äôs networking (typically Intel or Qualcomm card) is Wi-Fi¬†6E. One could swap in a Wi-Fi¬†7 module down the line, but antenna design might cap performance. Also, Blade 14 has no built-in Ethernet, relying on USB adapters or docks for wired networking (common for ultrathin). On the plus side, **PCIe¬†4.0** is still plenty for GPUs and SSDs in 2024; by the time PCIe¬†5 GPUs for laptops arrive, one would likely upgrade the whole machine. The Blade‚Äôs **USB4 ports** ensure it can connect to future USB4 peripherals and docks (even if not at v2 speeds). Summing up, the 2024 Blade 14 is **not aimed at bleeding-edge I/O or future expandability** ‚Äì it‚Äôs a refined snapshot of late-2023 tech. For the typical lifespan of 2-3 years for a gaming laptop, this is sufficient, but it won‚Äôt age as gracefully into the late 2020s as some more forward-looking designs.  
- **BIOS/Firmware Support:** Razer‚Äôs track record with laptop BIOS updates is mixed. They do issue updates to address critical issues (e.g., CPU boost behavior, compatibility with new RAM, or USB4 fixes), but often with some delay. The Blade 14 being a premium model gets a bit more attention ‚Äì for example, Razer might release a BIOS to support a new GPU firmware or Windows version quirks. However, Razer is not an enterprise vendor, so you shouldn‚Äôt expect years of security patches beyond the warranty period. Typically, major BIOS updates taper off after 1‚Äì2 years. Driver updates (e.g., for the NVIDIA GPU, chipset, etc.) are largely provided by component vendors (NVIDIA/AMD), and Razer‚Äôs support site often just mirrors those. One notable thing: firmware for USB4/Thunderbolt on AMD systems is sometimes tricky, but Razer did include USB4, so they had to validate eGPU and docking ‚Äì any issues there might prompt a firmware fix. The community sometimes finds undervolting locked or other BIOS limitations on Razer laptops; Razer doesn‚Äôt usually unlock such features via updates. In summary, the Blade 14 will get enough firmware support to iron out early problems and keep it stable under new OS updates for a couple years, but **long-term BIOS maintenance is not Razer‚Äôs focus**. Enthusiast owners may rely on community forums for tips or unofficial tweaks once Razer‚Äôs official support wanes.
